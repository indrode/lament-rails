- set up acceptance tests with factory-girl and capybara
- database migrations
- create index page (and use it as homepage?)
- create category pages
- think about website navigation


- add category model
- homepage should be index of all categories and related articles
- there is not category scaffold (categories are created via a rake command or the console)
- keep number of categories low, i.e. 4-5 max
- categories:
--- personal: anything, including projects
--- devops: git, application servers, 
--- linux: sysadmin stuff, server setup and maintenance; (maybe merge this with devops)
--- productivity: setting up the mac, recommended software, productivity hacks
--- code: anything code-related
